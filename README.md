# Docker-Management-Script

In this script, I have automated the process of creating Docker Images as well as launching Docker Images. 
Such an image can be launched either immediately after its creation or right after the script is initiated. 
Additionally, I have incorporated the functionality to publish a selected Docker Image to DockerHub.
With this script, there's no need for you to run anything additional or search for specific data, such as the 'Image ID'. 
A list of all Docker Images will be presented to you, and all you need to do is select the desired image from the list by 
specifying its ordinal number. Additionally, when creating an image, there is an option to add a tag to it. Similarly, 
when uploading to DockerHub, you also have the option to add a tag to the selected image before its publication.

This is my first script of this kind, and before its publication, it underwent 28 revisions and was completely rewritten more than 12 times. 
If it proves to be useful to you, then my time spent on it was not in vain.

All the best!
